# Pokemon-Card-Sorter
 Modified Nolan Amblard's Pokemon Card Scanner Code to include support for every card ever and implementation of Arduino communication to convert the script into a card sorting monster.

 To run code yourself:
 Install MySQL and set up local server
 Convert Pickles into MySQL databases using the first read code.
 Compile standard firmata on an arduino or arduino-based-microcontroller


 Future Work:
 Optimize image hashing and card comparison to be more efficient. The current solution involves using a limited database view which is compatible from SVI-SFA
 Update code to actuate servo instead of an RGB LED
 Include different sorting protocols
